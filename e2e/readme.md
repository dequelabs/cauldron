## Screenshot Testing

Screenshot testing uses [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [component testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components) to capture screenshots of components in different states for both light and dark themes.

To update existing snapshots run:

```sh
npm run screenshots --update-screenshots
```

To run tests run:

```sh
yarn screenshots
```
