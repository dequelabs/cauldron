```

## Example

The `Offscreen` component is a utility component to visually hide text while still providing accessible text to AT (Assistive Technology). This would be used in instances where a user using an AT tool would need additional context provided, or where `aria-label` could not be used (i.e. non-interactive elements), or when the user needs additional hints such as shortcut keys or controls to interact with the page.

```jsx example
<Link href="#Example" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Icon type="external-link" />

  <Offscreen>(Link opens in a new window)</Offscreen>
</Link>
```
