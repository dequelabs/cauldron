import { SkipLink } from '@deque/cauldron-react'

```jsx
import { SkipLink } from '@deque/cauldron-react'
```

The skip link is at the very top of the page, but it’s “hidden”. The link will be “activated” by navigating through the page with the Tab button right after the page is loaded.

## Example

```jsx example
<SkipLink target="#main-content" aria-label={"Skip"} />
```

## Props

### Step

<ComponentProps
  props={[
    {
      name: 'target',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description: 'Id of the element. It uses to navigate to the element.'
    },
    {
      name: 'skipText',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Text, which uses to indicate that the block is used to skip to',
      default: 'Skip to'
    },
    {
      name: 'targetText',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Text to indicate to which content the link navigate to',
      default: 'Main Content'
    }
  ]}
/>
