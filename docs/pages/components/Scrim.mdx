A scrim is a component that is a semi-transparent overlay over the viewport to provide emphasis, focus, or draw attention to certain information. This is most commonly used as a backdrop for dialogs and modals and other elements that need primary focus on the page.

<Note>
  It is recommended that a focus trap is used to contain keyboard focus within the element that has primary focus. [Alert](./Alert) and [Modal](./Modal) both use [react-focus-trap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/focus-trap-react) to manage focus. If `Scrim` is being used with other components, a focus trap may be needed to prevent certain keyboard accessibility issues.

  <Scrim show />
