## Implementing Cauldron Theming

Cauldron supports light and dark themes of all of its various components. Cauldron defaults to "light" themed components; to support "dark" themed components one of the following methods must be implemented.

## ThemeProvider

To give components access to the current theme, `ThemeProvider` must be added somewhere in the root of your application, wrapping all of cauldron's rendered components:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@deque/cauldron-react'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider initialTheme="light">
      <div>...</div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

The initial theme can be set with the values `light` or `dark`.

When using the `ThemeProvider`, a theme context object is also included to be able to access what the current theme is:

```jsx
import { useThemeContext, Button } from '@deque/cauldron-react'

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useThemeContext()

  return (
    <div>
      Current Theme: {theme}
      <Button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Global CSS Class

Alternatively if you are not using react and just using the styled components, the theme can be set by using a global css class somewhere in the root of your dom using the global class `cauldron--theme-dark` or `cauldron--theme-light` for the desired theme:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body class="cauldron--theme-dark">
    <div id="app">...</div>
  </body>
</html>
```
